You may be familiar with ZIP files (with the *.zip* file extension), which can hold the compressed contents of many other files. Compressing a file reduces its size, which is useful when transferring it over the Internet. And since a ZIP file can also contain multiple files and subfolders, it’s a handy way to package several files into one. This single file, called an *archive file*, can then be, say, attached to an email.

Your Python programs can both create and open (or *extract*) ZIP files using functions in the `zipfile` module.

## Reading ZIP Files

To read the contents of a ZIP file, first you must create a `ZipFile` object (note the capital letters *Z* and *F*). `ZipFile` objects are conceptually similar to the `File` objects you saw returned by the `open()` function in the previous chapter: They are values through which the program interacts with the file. To create a `ZipFile` object, call the `zipfile.ZipFile()` function, passing it a string of the *.zip* file’s filename.

**Note that`zipfile` is the name of the Python module, and `ZipFile()` is the name of the function**.

For example, enter the following into the interactive shell:

```python
   >>> import zipfile, os
   >>> os.chdir('C:\\')    # move to the folder with example.zip
   >>> exampleZip = zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip')
   >>> exampleZip.namelist()
   ['spam.txt', 'cats/', 'cats/catnames.txt', 'cats/zophie.jpg']
   >>> spamInfo = exampleZip.getinfo('spam.txt')
   >>> spamInfo.file_size
   13908
   >>> spamInfo.compress_size
   3828
❶ >>> 'Compressed file is %sx smaller!' % (round(spamInfo.file_size / spamInfo
   .compress_size, 2))
   'Compressed file is 3.63x smaller!'
   >>> exampleZip.close()
```

A `ZipFile` object has a `namelist()` method that returns a list of strings for all the files and folders contained in the ZIP file. These strings can be passed to the `getinfo()` `ZipFile` method to return a `ZipInfo` object about that particular file. `ZipInfo` objects have their own attributes, such as `file_size` and `compress_size` in bytes, which hold integers of the original file size and compressed file size, respectively. While a`ZipFile` object represents an entire archive file, a `ZipInfo` object holds useful information about a *single file* in the archive.

The command at ❶ calculates how efficiently *example.zip* is compressed by dividing the original file size by the compressed file size and prints this information using a string formatted with `%s`.

## Extracting from ZIP Files

The `extractall()` method for `ZipFile` objects extracts all the files and folders from a ZIP file into the current working directory.

```python
   >>> import zipfile, os
   >>> os.chdir('C:\\')    # move to the folder with example.zip
   >>> exampleZip = zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip')
❶ >>> exampleZip.extractall()
   >>> exampleZip.close()
```

After running this code, the contents of *example.zip* will be extracted to `C:\`. Optionally, you can pass a folder name to `extractall()` to have it extract the files into a folder other than the current working directory. If the folder passed to the`extractall()` method does not exist, it will be created. For instance, if you replaced the call at ❶ with `exampleZip.extractall('C:\\ delicious')`, the code would extract the files from *example.zip* into a newly created *C:\delicious* folder.

The `extract()` method for `ZipFile` objects will extract a single file from the ZIP file. Continue the interactive shell example:

```python
>>> exampleZip.extract('spam.txt')
'C:\\spam.txt'
>>> exampleZip.extract('spam.txt', 'C:\\some\\new\\folders')
'C:\\some\\new\\folders\\spam.txt'
>>> exampleZip.close()
```

The string you pass to `extract()` must match one of the strings in the list returned by `namelist()`. Optionally, you can pass a second argument to `extract()` to extract the file into a folder other than the current working directory. If this second argument is a folder that doesn’t yet exist, Python will create the folder. The value that`extract()` returns is the absolute path to which the file was extracted.

## Creating and Adding to ZIP Files

To create your own compressed ZIP files, you must open the `ZipFile` object in *write mode* by passing `'w'` as the second argument. (This is similar to opening a text file in write mode by passing `'w'` to the `open()` function.)

When you pass a path to the `write()` method of a `ZipFile` object, Python will compress the file at that path and add it into the ZIP file. The `write()` method’s first argument is a string of the filename to add. The second argument is the *compression type* parameter, which tells the computer what algorithm it should use to compress the files; you can always just set this value to `zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED`. (This specifies the *deflate* compression algorithm, which works well on all types of data.) Enter the following into the interactive shell:

```python
>>> import zipfile
>>> newZip = zipfile.ZipFile('new.zip', 'w')
>>> newZip.write('spam.txt', compress_type=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)
>>> newZip.close()
```

This code will create a new ZIP file named *new.zip* that has the compressed contents of *spam.txt*.

Keep in mind that, just as with writing to files, write mode will erase all existing contents of a ZIP file. If you want to simply add files to an existing ZIP file, pass `'a'`as the second argument to `zipfile.ZipFile()` to open the ZIP file in *append mode*.
