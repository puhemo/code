Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means it manipulates programming constructs called **objects**. You can think of an object as a single data structure that contains data as well as functions; functions of objects are called **methods**. 

A **class** is just a way of organizing and producing objects with similar attributes and methods.

Classes can be very useful for storing complicated objects with their own methods and variables.

```python
class Fruit(object):

    """A class that makes various tasty fruits."""
    def __init__(self, name, color, flavor, poisonous):
        self.name = name
        self.color = color
        self.flavor = flavor
        self.poisonous = poisonous
    
    def description(self):
        print "I'm a %s %s and I taste %s." % (self.color, self.name, self.flavor)
    
    def is_edible(self):
        if not self.poisonous:
            print "Yep! I'm edible."
        else:
            print "Don't eat me! I am super poisonous."

lemon = Fruit("lemon", "yellow", "sour", False)

lemon.description()
lemon.is_edible()
```

## Class Basics

A basic class consists only of the `class` keyword, the name of the class, and the class from which the new class **inherits** in parentheses.

```python
class NewClass(object):
    # Class magic here
```

### Initialize the objects

`__init__()` is required for classes, and it's used to **initialize** the objects it creates. `__init__()` always takes at least one argument, `self`, that refers to the object being created. You can think of `__init__()` as the function that "boots up" each object the class creates.

```python
class Fruit(object):

    """A class that makes various tasty fruits."""
    def __init__(self, name, color, flavor, poisonous):
        self.name = name
        self.color = color
        self.flavor = flavor
        self.poisonous = poisonous
```

 `self` is the *first* parameter passed to `__init__()`. Python will use the first parameter that `__init__()` receives to refer to the object being created; this is why it's often called `self`, since this parameter gives the object being created its identity.

### Instantiating Your First Object

```python
# Class definition
class Animal(object):
    """Makes cute animals."""
    # For initializing our instance objects
    def __init__(self, name, age, is_hungry):
    # In order to assign a variable to the class (creating a member variable)
    # we use dot notation.
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.is_hungry = is_hungry

# Note that self is only used in the __init__()
# function definition; we don't need to pass it
# to our instance objects.

zebra = Animal("Jeffrey", 2, True)
giraffe = Animal("Bruce", 1, False)
panda = Animal("Chad", 7, True)

print zebra.name, zebra.age, zebra.is_hungry
print giraffe.name, giraffe.age, giraffe.is_hungry
print panda.name, panda.age, panda.is_hungry
```

If you add additional arguments—for instance, a `name` and `age` for your animal—setting each of those equal to `self.name` and `self.age` in the body of `__init__()` will make it so that when you create an instance object of your `Animal` class, you need to give each instance a name and an age, and those will be associated with the particular instance you create.

### Class Scope

The **scope** of a variable is the context in which it's visible to the program.

When dealing with classes, you can have variables that are available everywhere (**global variables**), variables that are only available to members of a certain class (**member variables**), and variables that are only available to particular instances of a class (**instance variables**).

```python
class Animal(object):

    """Makes cute animals."""
    is_alive = True # Class Scope
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

zebra = Animal("Jeffrey", 2)
giraffe = Animal("Bruce", 1)
panda = Animal("Chad", 7)

print zebra.name, zebra.age, zebra.is_alive
print giraffe.name, giraffe.age, giraffe.is_alive
print panda.name, panda.age, panda.is_alive
```

### A Methodical Approach

When a class has its own functions, those functions are called **methods**. You've already seen one such method: `__init__()`. But you can also define your own methods!
```python
class Animal(object):

    """Makes cute animals."""
    is_alive = True
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    # Add your method here!
    def description(self):
        print self.name
        print self.age

hippo = Animal('Anna', 'John')

hippo.description()
```

### Modifying member variables

```python
class Car(object):

    condition = "new"
    def __init__(self, model, color, mpg):
        self.model = model
        self.color = color
        self.mpg   = mpg
    def display_car(self):
        return 'This is a %s %s with %d MPG.' % (self.color, self.model, self.mpg)
    def drive_car(self):
        self.condition = 'used'

my_car = Car("DeLorean", "silver", 88)
print my_car.condition
my_car.drive_car()
print my_car.condition
```

## Inheritance

**Inheritance** is the process by which one class takes on the attributes and methods of another, and it's used to express an **is-a** relationship. 

```python
class Customer(object):

    """Produces objects that represent customers."""
    def __init__(self, customer_id):
        self.customer_id = customer_id
    
    def display_cart(self):
        print "I'm a string that stands in for the contents of your shopping cart!"

class ReturningCustomer(Customer):
    """For customers of the repeat variety."""
    def display_order_history(self):
        print "I'm a string that stands in for your order history!"

monty_python = ReturningCustomer("ID: 12345")
monty_python.display_cart()
monty_python.display_order_history()
```
### Inheritance Syntax

In Python, inheritance works like this:

```python
class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    # code goes here
```

where `DerivedClass` is the new class you're making and `BaseClass` is the class from which that new class inherits.

### Override

Sometimes you'll want one class that inherits from another to not only take on the methods and attributes of its parent, but to **override** one or more of them.

```python
class Employee(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def greet(self, other):
        print "Hello, %s" % other.name

class CEO(Employee):
    def greet(self, other): # override
        print "Get back to work, %s!" % other.name

ceo = CEO("Emily")
emp = Employee("Steve")
emp.greet(ceo)
# Hello, Emily
ceo.greet(emp)
# Get back to work, Steve!
```

### Super

You can directly access the attributes or methods of a superclass with Python's built-in `super` call.

The syntax looks like this:

```python
class Derived(Base):
   def m(self, arg):
       return super(Derived, self).m(arg)
```

Where `m()` is a method from the base class.

```python
class Employee(object):

    """Models real-life employees!"""
    def __init__(self, employee_name):
        self.employee_name = employee_name
    
    def calculate_wage(self, hours):
        self.hours = hours
        return hours * 20.00

class PartTimeEmployee(Employee):
    def calculate_wage(sefl, hours):
        self.hours = hours
        return  hours*12.00
    def full_time_wage(self, hours):
        return super(PartTimeEmployee, self).calculate_wage(hours) # super
milton = PartTimeEmployee('Nobody')
print milton.full_time_wage(10)
```
