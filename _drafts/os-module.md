## os.walk()

# Walking a Directory Tree

Say you want to rename every file in some folder and also every file in every subfolder of that folder. That is, you want to walk through the directory tree, touching each file as you go. Writing a program to do this could get tricky; fortunately, Python provides a function to handle this process for you.

Let’s look at the *C:\delicious* folder with its contents, shown in [Figure 9-1](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter9/#calibre_link-99).

Here is an example program that uses the `os.walk()` function on the directory tree from [Figure 9-1](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter9/#calibre_link-99):

```python
import os

for folderName, subfolders, filenames in os.walk('C:\\delicious'):
    print('The current folder is ' + folderName)

    for subfolder in subfolders:
        print('SUBFOLDER OF ' + folderName + ': ' + subfolder)
    for filename in filenames:
        print('FILE INSIDE ' + folderName + ': '+ filename)

    print('')
```

The `os.walk()` function is passed a single string value: the path of a folder. You can use `os.walk()` in a `for` loop statement to walk a directory tree, much like how you can use the `range()` function to walk over a range of numbers. Unlike `range()`, the`os.walk()` function will return three values on each iteration through the loop:

1. A string of the current folder’s name
2. A list of strings of the folders in the current folder
3. A list of strings of the files in the current folder

(By current folder, I mean the folder for the current iteration of the `for` loop. The current working directory of the program is *not* changed by `os.walk()`.)

Just like you can choose the variable name `i` in the code `for i in range(10):`, you can also choose the variable names for the three values listed earlier. I usually use the names `foldername`, `subfolders`, and `filenames`.

When you run this program, it will output the following:

```
The current folder is C:\delicious
SUBFOLDER OF C:\delicious: cats
SUBFOLDER OF C:\delicious: walnut
FILE INSIDE C:\delicious: spam.txt

The current folder is C:\delicious\cats
FILE INSIDE C:\delicious\cats: catnames.txt
FILE INSIDE C:\delicious\cats: zophie.jpg

The current folder is C:\delicious\walnut
SUBFOLDER OF C:\delicious\walnut: waffles

The current folder is C:\delicious\walnut\waffles
FILE INSIDE C:\delicious\walnut\waffles: butter.txt.
```

Since `os.walk()` returns lists of strings for the `subfolder` and `filename` variables, you can use these lists in their own `for` loops. Replace the `print()` function calls with your own custom code. (Or if you don’t need one or both of them, remove the `for`loops.)
